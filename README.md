# hello-world
My first git-hub repository

Dark as the night that covers me
Black as the pit from pole to pole
I thank whatever Gods may be
For my unconquerable soul

On the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody but unbowed

Beyond these hills of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid

It matters not how strait the gait
How charged with punishments the scroll
I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul.
